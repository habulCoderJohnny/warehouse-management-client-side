                <h2>Que:3. What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h2>

                <p>JWT on its own is nothing but an open standard for transmitting messages via HTTP.</p>
                <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share information between two parties securely â€” a client and a server.
                    JWTs can be encrypted, but they are typically encoded and signed.
                    When it comes to API authentication and server-to-server authorization, JSON web token is particularly a useful technology.
                </p>
                <p>By sharing a secret key with the Identity Provider, the Service Provider can hash a part of a token it receives and compare it to the signature of the token. Now, if that result matches the signature, the SP knows that the information provided has come from the other entity possessing the key.</p>
